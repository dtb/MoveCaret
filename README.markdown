# MoveCaret

This is a sample project showing how to move the caret/text insertion point in a Win32 edit control.

Note: most of this is boilerplate code generated by Visual Studio 2010's project template. See [line 155](https://github.com/dtb/MoveCaret/blob/master/MoveCaret2/MoveCaret2.cpp#L155) of `MoveCaret2.cpp` for the code that manipulates the cursor.

The text box is created on [Line 199](https://github.com/dtb/MoveCaret/blob/master/MoveCaret2/MoveCaret2.cpp#L199) of the same file.
